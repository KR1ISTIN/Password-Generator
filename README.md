# Password Generator
Using JavaScript 

## Description
This project was about learning how to use JavaScript to create a password generator that met the requirements the user chose. I learned how to write a function that promts the user and then confirms which criteria the user would like to use to create a new password using the Math.floor() and Math.random(). This can be used for in the future when needing to come up with a secure password.
